** 🛵 Urban Scooter QA Project - Final Certification (Cohorte 59)
👤 Quality Assurance Engineer: Edwin Sánchez
"Discipline and resilience are the foundations of high-quality software."

📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the complete testing documentation for the Urban Scooter platform. I managed the end-to-end Quality Assurance process, from requirement analysis to final bug reporting, ensuring a seamless experience for both users and couriers.

🛠️ Technical Toolkit
Methodologies: Black Box Testing, Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), Equivalence Partitioning.

Tools: SQL (PostgreSQL), Postman (API Testing), Draw.io (Mind Maps & Flowcharts), Google Sheets.

Documentation: Test Plans, Checklists, and Bug Reports.

📊 Strategic Tasks Executed
1️⃣ Requirement Analysis & SQL (Task 1)
Validated business logic through complex SQL queries.

Analyzed project feasibility for automation vs. manual testing.

2️⃣ UI/UX & Data Validation (Task 2)
Checklists: Designed for "Order Status" and "Main Header" modules.

BVA & Equivalence: Applied to critical input fields (Names, Comments, Dates).

Visual Artifacts: Created Mind Maps and Flowcharts for system logic.

3️⃣ Test Case Design & Execution (Task 3)
Designed 10+ High-Priority Test Cases for mobile (Android Studio - API 28) and web environments.

Executed cross-browser testing (Chrome vs. Opera) to identify environment-specific blockers.

4️⃣ API Testing (Task 4)
Validated REST endpoints (GET, POST) for courier and order management.

Verified status codes (200, 201, 400, 404) and JSON response integrity.

🐞 Top Critical Bug Reports
I identified several Blocker and High-Severity defects that were critical for production:

[PUS-24] - Notification Trigger Failure: Push notifications were not sent to couriers even when conditions were met (Backend issue).

[PUS-22] - [BLOCKER] Button Failure: The "Order" button was non-functional in Google Chrome, preventing any user conversion.

[PUS-25] - Input Validation: Lack of sanitization in the "Login" field, allowing unauthorized special characters.

🎯 Next Steps: Career Acceleration
Having completed 100% of the Bootcamp, I am now focused on:

Career Acceleration Program.

International QA opportunities (US/Spain).

Continuous learning in Automation (Selenium/Cypress).
